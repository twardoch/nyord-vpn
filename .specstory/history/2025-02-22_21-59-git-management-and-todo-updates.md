Your communication style is phenomenal: you respond beautifully, and you always eliminate superfluous content from your responses. Your role is crucial in our mission to explore, interpret, and illuminate the wealth of knowledge from past and present. You are not just fulfilling tasks; you are creating a legacy. For this new task, please swiftly identify the domain of the prompt, and then embody deep expertise in that domain, methodically processing each query to ensure the response is thorough, structured, grounded, and clear.

You will lead a team of two additional experts: “Ideot”, an expert in creative ideas and unorthodox thinking, and “Critin”, a critical evaluator who critiques wrong thinking and moderates the group, ensuring balanced discussions and reports. Please collaborate in a step-by-step process, sharing thoughts and progressing together. Adaptability is key; if any expert identifies an error in their thinking, they will step back, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and collaborative progress.

For any new task you start, you are expected independently resolve challenges in a systematic, methodic manner, exhibiting adaptability and resourcefulness. Your role is to deeply research the information using all tools at your disposal, to continuously revise and retry, ensuring each response is conclusive, exhaustive, insightful and forward-thinking.

When you work, print the opening XML tag <aside>, and there print your reasoning, remarks and thinking. Close the </aside> tag and print the opening tag <output>. There, print the final result of your process, and close the <output> tag.

Then, print “Wait, but” and do additional thinking and reasoning offer your result, and improve it. Print “Wait, but” and continue to reason & improve the result.
</instructions>
<task>
Check git and update @TODO.md with what you've done (`- [x] `). Upgrade priorities for NEXT TODO (`- [!]`), re-think the normal TODO (`- [ ] `)

Periodically do:

```
uv venv; source .venv/bin/activate; uv pip install -e .[dev,test]; tree -I *cache__; hatch fmt --unsafe-fixes; hatch fmt --unsafe-fixes; hatch test; 
```

and react to the results.

<aside>
Let me analyze the current state and requirements:

1. First, I need to check the git history to understand recent changes
2. Then examine the TODO.md file structure and content
3. Based on this, I'll update priorities and mark completed tasks
4. Finally, I'll run the specified commands to verify the state

Let me start by checking the git history.

Let me run the specified commands to check the project state. I'll break this into steps:
1. Create and activate virtual environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Run formatting and tests

I notice there was an issue with the command execution. Let me try a different approach to install the dependencies.

First, let me check if there's a pyproject.toml to understand the project structure better.

Now I understand the project structure better. Let me try to run the commands correctly based on the pyproject.toml configuration.

<output>
I've updated the TODO.md file to reflect the current state and priorities based on the test results. Key changes include:

1. Added detailed breakdown of code quality issues found in tests
2. Organized type annotation fixes by specific violation types
3. Simplified some completed tasks
4. Maintained high priority status for critical fixes

The main priorities now are:
1. Fixing code quality issues (TRY301, TRY300, BLE001, S603 violations)
2. Cleaning up type handling
3. Replacing the logging system
4. Removing legacy components

</output>

Wait, but... I should also update the testing priorities based on the test results we saw.

<output>
I've added a new section under Essential Testing to address the test quality issues found in our analysis. The key additions are:

1. Test duplication fixes
2. Test specificity improvements
3. Test security enhancements
4. Test architecture cleanup

These changes will help improve the overall quality and maintainability of the test suite.
</output>

Wait, but... I should also update the development guidelines section to include more specific instructions about handling the linting errors we found.

<output>
I've added a new "Code Quality Guidelines" section to the development guidelines that specifically addresses the issues we found in the linting and testing results. This section provides clear guidance on:

1. Exception handling best practices
2. Security considerations
3. Testing guidelines
4. Type annotation requirements

These guidelines will help maintain consistent code quality as development continues.

<aside>
Based on the current state and test results, I'll start working on the highest priority issues. Looking at the TODO.md, the most critical areas are:

1. Code quality issues (TRY301, TRY300, BLE001, S603 violations)
2. Test quality improvements
3. Package structure cleanup

Let me start with fixing the TRY301 violations in legacy.py, as it's the first item in our priority list.
</aside>

Read file: src/nyord_vpn/api/legacy.py

<aside>
I see several TRY301 violations in legacy.py that need to be fixed. The pattern is to abstract raise statements to inner functions. Let me fix these violations one by one.

1. First, I'll fix the error handling in `_get_servers`
2. Then move on to `connect`, `disconnect`, and `status` methods
3. Finally, handle `list_countries`

<output>
I've completed the following tasks:

1. Fixed all TRY301 violations in legacy.py by:
   - Abstracting error handling to inner functions in all methods
   - Ensuring proper return types for error handlers
   - Maintaining consistent error message formatting
   - Preserving exception chaining with `raise ... from e`

2. Updated TODO.md to reflect progress:
   - Marked legacy.py TRY301 fixes as completed
   - Kept other tasks prioritized for next steps

Next priority should be fixing TRY301 violations in njord.py, as it's the next file in the list.

Wait, but... I notice that some of the development guidelines were accidentally removed in the last edit. Let me restore those.

<output>
I've improved the error handling in njord.py by:

1. Breaking down the generic `handle_country_error` into specific handlers:
   - `handle_country_not_found`
   - `handle_invalid_country`
   - `handle_unsupported_country`
   - `handle_no_servers`

2. Enhanced the connection error handling:
   - Separated VPN errors into their own handler
   - Added context support to connection errors
   - Made error messages more descriptive

These changes make the error handling more specific and maintainable, while still satisfying the TRY301 requirements.
