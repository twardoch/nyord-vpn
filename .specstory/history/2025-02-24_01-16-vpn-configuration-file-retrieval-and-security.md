How does tis tool obtain the config file?

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, this tool obtains the NordVPN configuration files through the following process in the `setup_config_directory()` function:

1. It downloads a zip file containing OpenVPN configurations from NordVPN's CDN:
```python:_private/nyord_vpn-mini.py
# Constants defined at the top
NORDVPN_CONFIG_DIR = Path("/etc/nordvpn_file")
OVPN_CONFIG_URL = "https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/servers/ovpn.zip"

def setup_config_directory() -> None:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Download and extract configurations
    try:
        response = requests.get(OVPN_CONFIG_URL, timeout=30)
        response.raise_for_status()

        zip_path = NORDVPN_CONFIG_DIR / "ovpn.zip"
        zip_path.write_bytes(response.content)

        # Extract the zip file
        subprocess.run(
            ["unzip", "-qq", str(zip_path), "-d", str(NORDVPN_CONFIG_DIR)],
            check=True,
        )
        zip_path.unlink()

        # Remove UDP configs as this tool only uses TCP
        udp_dir = NORDVPN_CONFIG_DIR / "ovpn_udp"
        if udp_dir.exists():
            shutil.rmtree(udp_dir)
```

The process is:
1. Creates a directory at `/etc/nordvpn_file` with proper permissions
2. Downloads a zip file from `https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/servers/ovpn.zip`
3. Extracts the zip file into the config directory
4. Removes the UDP configurations since this tool only uses TCP connections
5. The individual .ovpn config files are then used when connecting to specific servers

The config files are downloaded only once and reused for subsequent connections. When connecting to a server, it uses the appropriate .ovpn file from the extracted configurations:

```python:_private/nyord_vpn-mini.py
def connect_nordvpn(...):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Verify config file exists
    config_file = NORDVPN_CONFIG_DIR / "ovpn_tcp" / f"{server_name}.ovpn"
    if not config_file.is_file():
        msg = f"Config file not found: {config_file}"
        raise VPNError(msg)
```

Wait, but... there's a potential security consideration here: the config files are downloaded over HTTPS, but we should verify the SSL certificate and potentially add certificate pinning to ensure we're getting authentic configs from NordVPN. We could improve this by:

1. Adding certificate verification
2. Implementing SHA256 checksum verification of the downloaded zip
3. Adding error handling for corrupted zip files
4. Implementing periodic config updates to ensure we have the latest server configurations

Wait, but... we should also consider caching headers and implementing If-Modified-Since requests to avoid unnecessary downloads, and we could implement a fallback CDN URL in case the primary one fails.
