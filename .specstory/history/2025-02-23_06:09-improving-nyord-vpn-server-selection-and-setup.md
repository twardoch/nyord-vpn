## Improving nyord-vpn Server Selection and Setup (23/02/2025, 06:09:54)

_**User**_

In openpyn‑nordvpn the automated configuration handling is built into its initialization process. Key points include:

The main entry point in openpyn/main.py handles the “--init” flag. When you run the tool with “--init”, this part of the code kicks in to download and process the necessary configuration.

During initialization, the code downloads an “ovpn.zip” package that contains NordVPN’s OpenVPN configuration files. The extracted files are placed into the directory defined by the variable ovpn_folder—which you’ll find in openpyn/init.py (it’s set to the “files” subdirectory relative to the package base).

The same initialization branch also prompts for and then stores your NordVPN credentials in a file. The location for saving these credentials is defined by credentials_file_path in openpyn/init.py.

Together, these elements provide an automated setup: the “--init” branch in openpyn/main.py downloads and extracts the server configurations into the ovpn_folder and saves your authentication info in the credentials file. This modular approach allows the tool to offer a streamlined, one‑step initialization without forcing all users into it.


The server selection logic in openpyn‑nordvpn is a multi‑step process, broken into several components:

Retrieving and Filtering Server Data
The tool contacts NordVPN’s API to download a full list of servers. This happens in openpyn/api.py (using functions like get_json_cached and get_json) and then applies filtering based on country, protocol, and load. The filtering routines—likely defined in openpyn/filters.py—narrow the candidates down to a subset (for example, the least busy servers with a load below a given threshold).

Pinging Candidate Servers
Once the candidate list is determined, the tool “pings” each server to measure latency. It displays the ping statistics (min/avg/max/mdev) for each candidate. This step is part of the main connection logic (triggered from openpyn/main.py and/or client routines) where the best server is selected based on the lowest ping, ensuring optimal performance.

Final Server Selection
After comparing ping responses, the tool picks the best server (as shown by the log “Out of the Best Available Servers, Chose pl133”). This integrated process gives users an automated and dynamic way to always connect to a server with the best performance metrics.

These pieces work together seamlessly so that when you specify a country, openpyn‑nordvpn automatically retrieves server info, filters based on desired criteria, and then tests network performance to pick the best server without manual intervention.@api.py @api.py @initd.py @openpyn.py Inrorporate into @TODO.md specific and detailed instructions on how to improve the automatic server selection and improved setup in nyord-vpn using portions of code from @openpyn-nordvpn — don't be too greedy, we don't want to make nyord-vpn too bloded. Just convenient to use

I've analyzed the openpyn-nordvpn codebase and created a detailed TODO list with specific improvements for nyord-vpn. The recommendations focus on five key areas:

1. Smart Server Selection - Implementing efficient server data caching and filtering based on openpyn's approach
2. Connection Quality Testing - Adding latency-based server selection
3. Streamlined Setup - Creating a smooth initialization process
4. Quality of Life Improvements - Adding useful status displays
5. Error Handling & Recovery - Implementing robust fallback mechanisms

Each recommendation is:
- Specific and actionable
- Based on proven code from openpyn-nordvpn
- Focused on improving user experience
- Designed to be implemented incrementally

Wait, but let me think about potential improvements...

The recommendations could be enhanced by:
1. Adding specific metrics for server selection (e.g., weighted scoring combining load and latency)
2. Including configuration validation steps
3. Suggesting a modular architecture for easier testing and maintenance

Wait, but let me consider security aspects...

We should also consider:
1. Secure credential storage using system keyring
2. Regular validation of cached server data
3. Proper cleanup of sensitive data on exit
4. Secure handling of configuration files

The TODO list now provides a solid roadmap for improving nyord-vpn while keeping it focused and maintainable. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or provide more detailed code examples from openpyn-nordvpn for any of these improvements?

We just want autoselection of fastest server per country, and an easier setup. 

Also, check which NordVPN API endpoints we are using where.  see @api.py vs @client.py 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the API endpoint usage and refine the TODO list to focus on server autoselection and setup simplification.

First, let's compare the API endpoints being used:

**openpyn-nordvpn/api.py uses:**
1. `https://api.nordvpn.com/v2/servers?limit=16384` - Gets all servers at once
2. Uses semantic search for country codes/names

**nyord-vpn/client.py uses:**
1. `https://api.nordvpn.com/v1/servers/recommendations` - Gets recommended servers with filters
2. `https://api.nordvpn.com/v1/servers/countries` - Gets country list
3. `https://api.ipify.org` - IP checking
4. `https://nordvpn.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_user_info_data` - Connection verification

The main difference is that openpyn-nordvpn fetches all servers at once and does filtering locally, while nyord-vpn uses the recommendations API and lets NordVPN's backend do the filtering.

Let me update the TODO.md to focus on just the essential improvements:

I've simplified the TODO list to focus on three key areas:

1. **Enhanced Server Selection**
   - Implement latency-based server selection using NordVPN's recommendations API
   - Add parallel ping testing for faster selection
   - Cache recommendations to reduce API load

2. **Simplified Setup**
   - One-command initialization that handles all setup tasks
   - Focus on essential configuration only

3. **API Usage Optimization**
   - Stick with v1 recommendations API as primary (it's more efficient)
   - Add v2 servers API as fallback
   - Cache API responses

Key differences in API approach:
- openpyn-nordvpn downloads all servers and does heavy filtering locally
- nyord-vpn uses the recommendations API which is more efficient but less flexible
- We should keep using the v1 recommendations API as it's:
  1. More efficient (server-side filtering)
  2. Returns pre-filtered optimal servers
  3. Less likely to hit rate limits

Would you like me to provide specific code examples for any of these improvements?

_**User**_

But @@https://api.nordvpn.com/v2/servers https://api.nordvpn.com/v2/servers is not very big compared to @https://api.nordvpn.com/v1/servers/recommendations  and @https://api.nordvpn.com/v1/servers/countries 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you make a good point! Looking at the API responses, let me analyze this:

1. `v2/servers` is actually more efficient than I initially thought:
- Returns a compact list of all servers
- Includes essential data like load, status, and features
- Single request gets all data needed for filtering

2. Current approach in nyord-vpn using multiple v1 endpoints:
- `/v1/servers/recommendations` - Need to make multiple requests with different filters
- `/v1/servers/countries` - Separate call for country data
- More API calls overall

Let me revise the TODO.md to reflect this better approach:

---

_****_

```diff
  
  ### 1.1. Enhanced Server Selection
- - [ ] Improve server selection by adding latency-based filtering:
+ - [ ] Switch to v2/servers API for better efficiency:
+   ```python
+   def get_servers_cache() -> dict:
+       """Fetch and cache full server list from v2/servers:
+       1. Single API call to get all servers
+       2. Cache for 5 minutes
+       3. Local filtering by country/load/features
+       """
+   ```
+ - [ ] Implement fast server selection:
    ```python
-   def select_fastest_server(country_code: str) -> str:
-       """Get fastest server in a country by:
-       1. Get top 5 recommended servers from API
-       2. Ping each server to measure latency
-       3. Return server with lowest latency
+   def select_fastest_server(country_code: str, servers: dict) -> str:
+       """Select fastest server:
+       1. Filter cached servers by country
+       2. Take top 5 by load
+       3. Parallel ping test
+       4. Return fastest responding server
        """
    ```
- - [ ] Add parallel ping testing to speed up server selection
- - [ ] Cache server recommendations for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
  
  ### 1.2. Simplified Setup
  
  ### 1.3. API Usage Optimization
- - [ ] Consolidate API endpoints:
-   - Use v1 recommendations API instead of full server list
-   - Add fallback to v2 servers API if recommendations fail
-   - Cache successful API responses for 5 minutes
+ - [ ] Consolidate to v2/servers endpoint:
+   - Single API call instead of multiple v1 endpoints
+   - Local filtering instead of multiple API requests
+   - Simpler error handling (only one endpoint)
+   - Keep v1 endpoints as fallback only
  
  Keep it focused on these core improvements that directly enhance user experience.
```

The revised strategy is better because:

1. **More Efficient:**
- One API call to `v2/servers` instead of multiple v1 calls
- Complete dataset available locally for filtering
- Reduced API load and latency

2. **More Reliable:**
- Less dependency on multiple endpoints
- Simpler error handling
- Better control over server selection logic

3. **Better Caching:**
- Cache single response instead of multiple endpoints
- More efficient memory usage
- Easier to implement and maintain

This approach is closer to openpyn-nordvpn's strategy but with modern improvements. Would you like me to provide a code example for either the caching mechanism or the server selection logic?
