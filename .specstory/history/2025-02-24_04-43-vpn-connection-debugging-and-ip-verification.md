_**Assistant**_

I notice a few issues in the VPN connection handling based on the logs:

1. The IP verification seems to be relying too heavily on a single service (api.ipify.org) rather than achieving consensus among multiple services as intended in the code.

2. The country and server information is not being properly propagated to the status output, even though we successfully connected to `fr541.nordvpn.com`.

Let me improve the code to address these issues:

I've made several improvements to the code:

1. Enhanced IP consensus mechanism:
   - Now tracks the number of successful service calls separately from valid IPs
   - Requires either 3+ services to agree on an IP or majority consensus from successful services
   - Added more detailed logging about consensus decisions

2. Improved server info handling:
   - Added explicit country parameter documentation
   - Store server info (hostname and country) earlier in the connect process
   - Added `_save_state()` call after updating connection info to ensure persistence

3. Removed redundant code and improved error handling:
   - Removed duplicate IP validation logging
   - Consolidated connection info updates
   - Improved state management

Let me also verify that the state saving is working correctly:

Let me make one more improvement to ensure the state is properly saved and the process ID is tracked:

I've made several improvements to ensure proper state management and better logging:

1. Enhanced state saving:
   - Added process ID tracking in state
   - Added verbose logging of state changes
   - Moved initial IP storage earlier in the connection process

2. Improved process tracking:
   - Added explicit PID logging when process starts
   - Ensured process ID is saved in state

3. Better connection info:
   - Added country name to connection success message
   - Improved state saving at key points in the connection process

These changes should resolve the issues with:
1. Country and server information not being displayed
2. Better IP verification through improved consensus mechanism
3. More reliable state tracking and persistence

The VPN connection manager will now:
1. Properly store and persist server and country information
2. Require stronger consensus for IP verification
3. Track process IDs for better process management
4. Provide more detailed logging about state changes

Let me know if you'd like me to make any additional improvements or if you have any questions about the changes.

Wait, but... let me also check the status method to ensure it properly uses this improved state:

I've made significant improvements to the status method:

1. Better process tracking:
   - First checks for our specific OpenVPN process using stored PID
   - Falls back to checking for any OpenVPN process if needed
   - Added verbose logging of process status

2. Improved location info handling:
   - Better handling of country and city info from NordVPN API
   - Falls back to stored values if API doesn't provide them
   - Added verbose logging of location info sources

3. Enhanced connection status checking:
   - More detailed connection status verification
   - Better logging of each condition that determines connection status
   - Improved error handling and fallback behavior

4. Better state management:
   - Uses stored state more effectively
   - Preserves city info across API failures
   - More consistent handling of unknown values

These changes should resolve the issues with missing country and server information in the status output, while also making the connection status checking more reliable.

Let me know if you'd like me to make any additional improvements or if you have any questions about the changes.
