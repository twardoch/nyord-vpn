After each set of changes, update @TODO.md with what you've done (`- [x] `). Upgrade priorities for NEXT TODO (`- [!]`), re-think the normal TODO (`- [ ] `)

Periodically do:

```
uv venv; source .venv/bin/activate; uv pip install -e .[dev,test]; tree -I *cache__; hatch fmt --unsafe-fixes; hatch fmt --unsafe-fixes; hatch test; 
```

and react to the results. Use `uv pip...` instead of `pip...` if needed.
